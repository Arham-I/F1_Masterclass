# F1 Race Weekend Companion

A companion app that follows an F1 weekend session by session. After each session
(FP1 → FP2 → FP3 → Qualifying, plus Sprint sessions on sprint weekends) it refreshes the
charts for that session.

**Status: Day 1 of a 3-day build.** Working today: data pipeline, replay mode, and three
per-session charts. **Not built yet:** race-result prediction, backtest, generated commentary,
notifications.

## What you can do in the app

Pick a finished weekend (default: 2026 Spanish GP) and press **Next session**. Replay mode
releases the weekend one session at a time, as if it were happening now, and the app can only
see sessions that have already "happened". The Race is never revealed. Each session shows:

- **Gap to fastest lap**: best valid lap per driver
- **Long-run pace**: lap-time spread on long stints, compared with the field on the *same*
  compound so soft and hard runners are comparable
- **Tyre stints**: every stint per driver, by compound

## Run locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

The app reads only the derived files in `data/` and does **not** need FastF1 or network access.

## Rebuild the data (optional)

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python scripts/backfill.py --years 2026            # or 2022 2023 2024 2025
python -m pytest tests
```

Notes from building this:
- FastF1 is rate-limited (~500 API calls/hour). The backfill waits and retries instead of
  skipping, and takes many hours for a cold multi-year pull. Cached sessions rebuild in minutes.
- The backfill skips sessions already in `data/`. After changing `f1cc/features.py`, delete
  `data/*.parquet` and re-run it; otherwise old rows are silently kept. `tests/test_data_freshness.py`
  fails if stored data no longer matches the current code.

## Data and known limitations

- Data comes from [FastF1](https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1), which reads Formula 1's public
  timing feed. Coverage here: 2022-2026, 460 sessions.
- Long-run pace is confounded by fuel load, which the feed does not expose. Treat it as a
  relative signal, not an absolute one.
- Long-run comparison uses dry compounds only, so wet sessions show few or no long runs.
- Official team colours changed mid-season in 2024 and 2025; each round uses its own palette.
- Several team colours are close (e.g. Williams / Red Bull blues), so every mark is also labelled
  with its driver code rather than relying on colour alone.
